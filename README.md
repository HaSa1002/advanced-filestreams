# Advanced Filestreams
It's a small - currently in development - library for a more comfortable access to filestreams and is mainly a helper for XML file handling.

# How to use? #
Download the latest release and unzip it. The you need to link the include and lib paths. If you have a release solution, then you need to import the normal .dll and .lib, but if you use a debug solution then you need to link the -d.dll and -d.lib files. A documentation file is provided in the include folder.
